Where do i begin ahahahaha. Man its been so long.

Number Systems in computers was a stupidly simple project that i made back in 2020, when i was a 12 yr old, full of cringe.

This readme is being written in god forbid 2024, i just did not have the courage to touch and document the past.
There were no readmes made back then, i esentially used github as file storage :(

This was a simple program made from programming concepts that i learnt around that year like different number systems, and how to interconvert between them.
They were made in java which was supposed to be displayed using iframe? elements in the page but their behavior has changed so now it just downloads them.

There are 15 files, 14 of them being interconverts of different number systems and the other file being a java class which called an instance of all interconverters
and used them in a self repeating terminal program fashion, it was what was taught to us, terminal input interface based systems.

I believe it was an excellent application of programs by what i knew at that time. html and css were leant beforehand so it was fairly easy putting a info website.

This program was being made alongside a simple java program of terminal space arcade. But it was too much for me to handle so i left it.
I still have the incomplete code backuped somewhere else. Had the rendering systems made but logic and physcs too much i guess :).

Maybe i will revisit them idk.

Fin.
