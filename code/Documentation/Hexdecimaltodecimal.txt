Hexa Decimal to Decimal
This is bit complicated
and
interesting at the same time
Algorithm
1.Accept a hexdecimal string from the user, since a hexdecimal umber can have
both characters and numbers string is best.
2.Now make a for loop whose changing value is a variable name of your choice
its range is hexdm number - 1, since the index number of a character of a string
starts with 0 its total range is lenght considered from 1 - 1;
3.To be logical we are using lenght(); function to find the lenght it finds it in
natural number format and needs to be converted to whole number list thus the
expression
4.A step of 1 with every operation
5.Now sepearte the character from string by charAt() function whose radixx is
the vraible of the for loop.
6.Now we have the n charcter of the loop, make a list of type string which
is "0123456789ABCDEF";
7.now take this character as a radixx and use it as an argument to find the
decimal value for the character.
8.Yay we have the decimal value now multiply it with the succesive powers of 10
in formula decimal = hexdivision * (variable type)Math.pow(10,p) + decimal;
9.Thus after the for loop is completed then the decimal value is obtained
10.There is no need of dividing the source value here as we linear scan the 
target variable, not mathematically find it.
