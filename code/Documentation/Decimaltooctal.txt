Decimal to Octal:
This is pretty easy
with a
hard formula
Algorithm
1.Accept a Decimal number
2.Create a while loop in which operation works.
3.Find remainder upon dividing the decimal number by 8
4.That rem is key value use it to create the octal string.
5.Formula = octalnumber = rem * (long)Math.pow(10,p) + octalumber;
6.now divide decimal number by 8 to structure the operation properly.
