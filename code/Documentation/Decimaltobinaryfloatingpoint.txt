This is simple and easy to do
1.Seperate the natural/whole number part and the decimal part
2.Convert the natural num part to binary using decimal to binary algorithm
3.Convert the decimal part to decimal binary using the algoritm shown below
3.As we need the integer part of the decimal number after multiplying by 2 and after being greater than
1 then revert its source value to decimal so
4.Multiply the decimal by 2
5.then get the integer value and change to decimal only if it is above 1 or not
