Binary to Octal
This is 
genuinely
interesting
A first case of nested loops
Algorithm
1.Accept a binary value in integer form through any integer varibale (long
is recommended)
2.Now as we need to both seperate a 3 bit part and convert it to decimal and
add it to create the division value which gets added in a pattern manner to form
that octal value need two loops one after another i.e A nested loop.
3.Now create a while loop to Seperate a 3 bit part by % 1000
4.Now we have to convert that 3 bit binary to octal. So apply the binary to
decimal changing algorithm within the while loop in the main while loop
5.Now use formula = Octalnumber = decimalpart * (variable type)Math.pow(10,p) + Octalnumber;
6.Vollia after completion of the main loop we get the answer in octal type.
