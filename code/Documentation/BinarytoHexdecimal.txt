Binary to Hexadecimal
This is also quite easy
and
enjoyable to do.
Algorithm
1.Accept the binary value as long variable in value int
2.Now Create a nested loop
3.In the first loop make a while loop which will works until binary string 
is not equal to 0.
4.Then find the remainder on dividing by 10000;
5.Then create another while loop which converts it into a decimal value by
using the binary to decimal value converting algoritm.
6.Now we create a string variable list = "0123456789ABCDEF";
7.now we use the decimal value as its radixx for char at function to
seperate the chexadecimal character for the 4 bit part
8.Now as it is string add them linearly.
9.Thus after all the operation the program is completed and we have the hexa
decimal value.
