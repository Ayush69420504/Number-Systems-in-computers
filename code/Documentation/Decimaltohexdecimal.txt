Decimal to Hexadecimal
This one is pretty dangerous to think of
but at the same time if we understand it
then it is pretty easy.
Algorithm
1.Accept the decimal value
2.Then create a while loop which works while decimal number is not equal to 0
3.in that find the remainder upon dividing by 16
4.Then comes the interseting part, as a hexadecimal number has both number and
character thus we have to connvert it into a string format.
5.We can initilize a list string of value = "0123456789ABCDEF";
6.We can find the correct hexnumber by using list.charAt((int)remanider);
7.charat allows us to take the charcter from the string of the desired radix
8.The radix or the argument value is always in int value if the rem is in 
different varible type, perform an explicit conversion.
9.Thus we add it as a char type to a string which is the answer, since it is a 
string data type, no complex formulae is required to maintain a pattern, only
correct placement.
10.Do not forget to divide the decimal by 16 in order to continue the operation
properly.
