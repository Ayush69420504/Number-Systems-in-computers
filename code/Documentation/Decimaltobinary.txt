Converting from Decimal to Binary:
It is pretty simple logic
with a
pretty hard formula to create the binary pattern.
Algorithm
1.Accept a integer value in long variable (long is recommended so that it
can accept large numbers)
2.Create a while loop on basis that it works until decimal value is not
equal to 0
3.now seperate the 1 or 0 remanider by % 2 function
4.Now use formula (binarynumber = remanider * (long)Math.pow(10,p) + binarynumber;
5.Upon succesive looping it creates the binary string from m.s.b to l.s.b;
6.Divide the decimal at last by 2 to perform operation properly and create
a end stateent for the loop.
