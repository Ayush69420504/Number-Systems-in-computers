This is a program or to be accurate a package of programs which can perform all 13 possible number format conversions
in java. It is uses different types of logic and functions to achieve it.

Though point ot be noted.
It does not use any kind of inbuilt function that can result to the answer at once. Since that is nothing more than
CHEATING.

We will use CUSTOM LOGIC to do the programs, it really helps us to understand how these operations work in computer terms. Plus CUSTOM LOGIC is cool and epico.

Note:
This is not copied from any online java program site, and it will not exactly match, and many programs are not even found
on internet. Very strange, i know.

Key feauters of the java package.
1. It is represents every function as a seperate .java (java file)
2. There is a single parent java file which can run all the functions simultaneously.
3. Since each function has it's own java class, there is a lot of usage flexibility,
We can call a class to perform a single function we want or we can call the parent class to call all Functions.
4. Programs are made in the most memory efficient way possible and even first microproccessors running 2800 nm dies 
with core clocks of 0.1 mhz can run it.
5. There is total of 577 lines of code, shared unevenly by the 15 java files of the package.
