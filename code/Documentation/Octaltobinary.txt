Octal to Binary
This one is
that kid at school who
explains a easy thing
in a complicated manner.
Algorithm
1.Accept a octal number
2.We need a nested loop.
3.Create a while loop with the condition that works until octal number is not
equal = 0
4.Divide the octal number by 10 and find the remainder thus you just separate
a digit from there.
5.Now convert that into a binary string.
6.Now the tricky part is to add them together and create a binary pattern.
7.So we will use = Binarystring = binarypart * (variable type)Math.pow(10,p) + Binarystring;
8.Thus it will create a 3 bit sapce for the three bit pattern to be added and
thus will create the octal number.
