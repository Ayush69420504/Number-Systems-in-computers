Hexa decimal to binary
This is also
quite tricky to understand
but is easy
Algorithm
1.Accept the hexa decimal string
2.Now make a nested loop.
3.The first one is a for loop in which we seperate the charcter from first
by using charat function.
4.Now in the child while loop, we find the index value of the character obtained
by the function
5.Now we use that value to find the binary value by decimal to binary algorithm
6.Now we use formula binarynumber = binarynumber * Math.pow(10,4) + binarypart;
to find the binary string in correct order.
