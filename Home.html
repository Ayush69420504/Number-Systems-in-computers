Hello My name is Ayush Karmakar, this is my first website i have built and i am quite excited to know how
people react to it. It has been kept very simple and fluid by using only html and css. This will however
not remain the data of this home page as i will soon make a full fleged blog website where this website will
be included. I am very Eager to see what will happen in the long run. Maybe a full fleged blog
where new Information is present will not be created in the near future and by that i mean next 4 years
I may finish a full website blog but may remain dead for those 4 years. Lets see.
</p>
<h2 align = "center">Navigation of site</h2>
<ol>
<li>There are three windows</li>
<ol>
<li>List window<br>= From where you can navigate to different webpages</li>
<li>Main window<br>= Where everything is shown abut the webpage you clicked on</li>
<li>Title window<br>= You can return to home from here and you contact me from here</li>
</ol>
<li>Main window works sincrously with the list and thus helps in easier naigation</li>
<li>Any queries to be cleared or any suggestion to help site can be done from "contact me" and will be highly appreciated</li>
</ol>
</body>
