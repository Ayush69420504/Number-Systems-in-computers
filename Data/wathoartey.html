<h2>Now lets come to the main question of:</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>How are they represented</li>
<li>How do you change from one form to another</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>They are represnted in the following manner:</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Decimal number system.<br>
<img src = "C:\Users\ayush\Desktop\Number-System-in-computers\Images\base10.jpg"></img></li>
<li>Binary number system.<br>
<img src = "C:\Users\ayush\Desktop\Number-System-in-computers\Images\base2.jpg"></img></li>
<li>Octal number system<br>
<img src = "C:\Users\ayush\Desktop\Number-System-in-computers\Images\base8.jpg"></img></li>
<li>HexaDecimal number system<br>
<img src = "C:\Users\ayush\Desktop\Number-System-in-computers\Images\base16.jpg"></img></li>
</ol>
<h2>Thus if they are put in a table with the range of HexaDecimal being the maximum then:</h2>

<h2>How do you convert from one form to another ?</h2>
<p>
There are 4 number systems of computers, now each can be converted to 3 other types and thus we have 4 * 3 = 12 + 2 (2 other types) = 14 types of conversions.They are:<br>
<ol>
<li>Decimal to binary<br>
= Here as we have to convert from base10 to base2 thus we divide the number by 2 and store the remainder and then the last
remainder is the first digit of the binary number and first remainder is the last digit of the binary number. We call it as
Msb(Most significant bit) to Lsb(Least significant bit). Now we arange it in msb to lsb</li>
<li>Binary to decimal<br>
= Here as we convert from base2 to base10 thus we start operating from lsb to msb. We take that particular digit and
then multiply it with the respective power of 2. At lsb it is 0 then it increases as we move towards the msb. Thus it is
the length of the number if calculated from 1 or lenght in natural number system - 1.</li>
<li>Decimal to octal<br>
= Here as we have to convert from base10 to base8 thus we divide the base10 number by 8 and keep storing the remainder.
Thus the last remainder becomes the first digit of the octal number and the first remainder becomes the last digit of 
the octal number. Now we arrange it in msb to lsb pattern.</li>
<li>Octal to decimal<br>
= Here as we have to convert from base8 to base10 thus we start operating from lsb to msb. We take the digit and then
multiply it with the correct power of 8, at lsb power of eight is 0 and increases with movement to msb. And then their sum 
is the decimal number.</li>
<li>Decimal to hexadecimal<br>
= Here you convert by dividing the decimal number by 16 and then finding the remainder which is in decimal then we 
convert it to hexadecimal by the table shown above. Basically after 9 you represnet the numbers with characters of 
english in their traditinal order.</li>
<li>HexaDecimal to Decimal<br>
= Here we take each character of the hexanumber from lsb and then multiply it with powers of 16 which increases upon
moving towards the msb. At lsb power is 0. Thus the sum of the product of each of the characters gives the result. If
we have to multiply a letter then use its decimal value</li> 
<li>Octal to binary<br>
= Here we have to take each character of the octal number then we have to perform a decimal to binary conversion on it
then we add it as a string and not a number so the octal number turns into a string of its binary form of characters
the arrangmenet is msb to lsb. Also the binary part should be of three chararcters. if less just add zeros in front.</li>
<li>Binary to octal<br>
= Here we take a three bit part of the binary string from lsb and then convert it to decimal and then add it as a 
string from the lsb. Thus each part is then properly put and thus the octal number is formed.</li>
<li>HexaDecimal to binary<br>
= Here we have to take each character of the HexaDecimal number then we have to perform a decimal to binary conversion on it
then we add it as a string and not a number so the HexaDecimal number turns into a string of its binary form of characters
the arrangmenet is msb to lsb. Also the binary part should be of four chararcters. If less just add zeros in front.</li>
<li>Binary to HexaDecimal<br>
= Here we take a three bit part of the binary string from lsb and then convert it to decimal and then add it as a 
string from the lsb. Thus each part is then properly put and thus the octal number is formed.</li>
<li>Octal to HexaDecimal<br>
= Here we convert the octal to binary then the binary to hexadecimal.</li>
<li>HexaDecimal to Octal<br>
= Here we convert the hexadecimal to binary then the binary to octal.</li>
<li>Fractional decimal to fractional binary<br>
= Here we convert the integer part of the decimal to binary which is integer in the normal way but to convert the fractional
part we multiply the fractional decimal part then seperate/take its integer part and then add it from msb and form another
part which is then written with a after the integer part with a dot. Thus integer part becomes integer and that part beceomes the fractional part. This operation can be repeated as many times as you want but 8 is max.</li>
<li>Fractional binary to Fractional decimal<br>
= Here you take the integer binary part and convert it to decimal in the normal manner. Then we seperate the respective 
fractional binary digit from msb and then multiply it with the succesive negative exponent of 2. It starts from -1 and goes
upto lsb thus at lsb we have the highest negative exponent. Thus their sum gives rise to the fractional decimal part</li>
</ol>

<h2>Next we will look at how to code programs which convert the forms from one to another. It is in java as many schools
still use java to teach students</h2>
