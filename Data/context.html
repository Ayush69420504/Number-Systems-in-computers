<p>This is a program or to be accurate a package of programs which can perform all 13 possible number format conversions
in java. It is uses different types of logic and functions to achieve it.</p>

<p>Though point to be noted.
It does not use any kind of inbuilt function that can result to the answer at once. Since that is nothing more than
CHEATING.</p>

<p>We will use CUSTOM LOGIC to do the programs, it really helps us to understand how these operations work in computer terms. Plus CUSTOM LOGIC is cool and epico.</p>

<p>Note:
This is not copied from any online java program site, and it will not exactly match, and many programs are not even found
on internet. Very strange, i know.</p>

<p>Key features of the java package.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is represents every function as a seperate .java (java file)</li>
<li>There is a single parent java file which can run all the functions simultaneously.</li>
<li>Since each function has it's own java class, there is a lot of usage flexibility,
We can call a class to perform a single function we want or we can call the parent class to call all Functions.</li>
<li>Programs are made in the most memory efficient way possible and even first microproccessors running 2800 nm dies 
with core clocks of 0.1 mhz can run it.</li>
<li>There is total of 577 lines of code, shared unevenly by the 15 java files of the package.</li>
