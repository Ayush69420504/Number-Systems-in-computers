Computers are one of the most usefull, sofisticsted, and advanced systems of data proccessing and communication
They have remained for 50+ years and have undergone a lot of modifications and upgrades to reach such an extent
where all tasks seem instant. Quantum computers arriving in a few years will change the limits of traditional
computers and will make simulations previously thought immposible in traditional computers possible
</p>
<p>
Now if we introduce the question that how do computers work then number systems join the chat. The four number systems
of the computer contain all the fundamental data's of the computer which are intrpreted to communicate with us. As 
traditional languages and numbers are foreign to a working transistor thus these formats are used.
</p>
<p>
So what are these numbers systems which control the computer, well they are =<br>
<ol>
<li>Decimal number system<br>= The number system which humans use to communicate with a man/woman (i am not sexist) or machine.</li>
<li>Binary number system<br>= The primary number system of computers which regulate and control their working</li>
<li>Octal number system<br>= Another number system used by computers in registry and etc</li>
<li>Hexadecimal number system<br>= Another number system used by computers to generate codes and etc</li>
</ol>
